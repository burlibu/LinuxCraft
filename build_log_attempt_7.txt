To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve net.neoforged:neoforge:21.0.167.
     Required by:
         project :
      > Multiple incompatible variants of net.neoforged:neoforge:21.0.167 were selected:
           - Variant modDevApiElements has attributes {org.gradle.category=library, org.gradle.dependency.bundling=external, org.gradle.status=release, org.gradle.usage=java-api}
           - Variant universalJar has attributes {org.gradle.category=library, org.gradle.dependency.bundling=external, org.gradle.jvm.version=21, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, org.gradle.status=release, org.gradle.usage=java-runtime}

> There is 1 more failure with an identical cause.

* Try:
> Incompatible variant errors are explained in more detail at https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/userguide/variant_model.html#sub:variant-incompatible.
> Review the variant matching algorithm at https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/userguide/variant_attributes.html#sec:abm_algorithm.
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
